# EpiConn

Welcome! This repository carries out core analyses and visualizations for exploring the spatiotemporal dynamics of structure-function coupling in drug-resistant epilepsy. We have provided a sample dataset, and our methods can be applied to your own datasets. Input data includes 45 seizures from 9 patients (along with interictal data), and structural networks derived from HARDI tractography. Note: metrics derived from permuted data may vary slightly each time the pipeline is run due to randomization inherent to the procedure.

This serves as a supplement to our paper in submission at Brain, also available here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/04/406793. Please see paper for details on image acquisition, processing, and analysis.
