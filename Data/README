In this file, we have provided the processed data necessary to run the jupyter notebook. This includes:
1) Frequency-dependent FC networks for each seizure event clip (preictal + ictal periods) for each subject. 
These have been processed which have been processed according to the Echobase pipeline developed by Khambhati et al. (https://github.com/akhambhati/Echobase)

2) Structural networks for each subject, generated by HARDI tractography. 
The ROIs used are from the AAL-600 atlas, and the final network was such that each electrode was associated with one structural ROI.
See paper for further details.

3) Node labels. These are the labels for the nodes of both the structural and functional networks. They were named using the clinical electrode names, 
and are consistent with the electrode names used on the IEEG portal.
