In this file, we have provided example data  to run the jupyter notebook. This includes:

1) Structural networks for each subject, generated by HARDI tractography. 
The ROIs used are from the AAL-600 atlas, and the final network was such that each electrode was associated with one structural ROI.
See paper for further details.

2) Node labels. These are the labels for the nodes of both the structural and functional networks. They were named using the clinical electrode names, 
and are consistent with the electrode names used on the IEEG portal.

3) Frequency-dependent FC networks for each seizure event clip (preictal + ictal periods). 
These files are large and therefore 1 seizure is provided for an example subject. More are available upon request, please contact the author.
These files can also be easily generated on a new dataset using the Echobase pipeline developed by Khambhati et al. (https://github.com/akhambhati/Echobase)
